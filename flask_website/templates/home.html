  <!-- <p id='HomeHeader2'> Compare players to see who been good in last 2 minutes of a close game.
                        I looked at the play by data from pervious 14 seasons (2004-2018), and
                        got the stats for each player whne the game was within 6 points and
                        only 2 minutes to play in the regulation during that span. If the game
                        went to overtime, the full overtime stats were taken in account.
